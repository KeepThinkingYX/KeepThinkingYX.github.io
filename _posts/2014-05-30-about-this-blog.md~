Hello, everyone. This is the first say hello by myself in this blog.

Thanks JerryZhang for build this frame for me, and gave me many references about how to use github, jekyll and markdown. And Thanks ZixiangLu for install Ubuntu 14.04 in my PC.

From today, I will write something in here about my research, my interesting thing and my life.

Let's enjoy programming and linux!
